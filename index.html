                This is a turn-based game played with two or more players.
                <br><br>
                During their turn, the active player first reads the question on their card out loud to the other players and silently reads the 
                answer on their card.
                <br><br>
                The active player can then either repeat the true answer to the question in their own words or "Bullsh*t" and make up a false 
                answer. They may refer to the true answer on their card for reference.

              <div class="slide-content">
                Once the active player has finished, the other players guess whether the active player's answer is true or false.
                When all players have stated their guesses, the active player reveals if they told the truth or not.

                All players begin the game with zero points.
                Each player that guessed correctly gains one point. If not, they do not gain or lose any points.

                The device is then passed to the next player, who presses the "next" button for the next card.

                This process is repeated until at least one player accumulates 10 points, becoming the winner of the round.
